<Section>
<Heading>Coset Geometries</Heading>

Suppose we have an <E>incidence
geometry</E> &Gamma; (as defined in chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/>), together with
a group <M>G</M> of automorphisms of &Gamma; such that <M>G</M> is
transitive on the set of <E>chambers</E> of &Gamma; (also
defined in chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/>). This implies
that <M>G</M> is also transitive on the set of all elements of any
chosen type <M>i</M>. If we consider a chamber <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\{c_{1},c_{2},... ,c_{n}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>\{c_{1},c_{2},... ,c_{n}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">c&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,c&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,c&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub></Alt>
such that <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> is of type <M>i</M>,
we can look at the stabilizer <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt>
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> in <M>G</M>. The
subgroups  <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> are
called <E>parabolic subgroups</E> of &Gamma;. For a
type <M>i</M>, transitivity of <M>G</M> on the elements of
type <M>i</M> gives a correspondence between the cosets of the
stabilizer <Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> and the elements of type <M>i</M>
in &Gamma;. Two elements of &Gamma; are incident if and only
if the corresponding cosets have a nonempty intersection.<P/>

We now use the above observation to define an incidence structure from
a group <M>G</M> together with a set of
subgroups <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\{G_{1},G_{2},...,G_{n}\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>\{G_{1},G_{2},...,G_{n}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">G&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,G&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,G&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub></Alt>.
The type set is <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\{1,2,...,n\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>\{1,2,...,n\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">&#123;1,2,...,n&#125;</Alt>.
By definition the elements of type <M>i</M> are the (right) cosets of the subgroup 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>G_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">G&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt>. Two
cosets are incident if and only if their intersection is not
empty. This is an incidence structure which is not necessarily a
geometry (see Chapter <Ref Chap="incidencegeometry"/> for definitions). In order to check whether a coset incidence structure is indeed a
geometry you can use the command <F>IsFlagTransitiveGeometry</F> which (in case it returns <F>true</F>) guarantees that the argument is a geometry.

<Heading>Automorphisms, Correlations and Isomorphisms</Heading>
An <E>automorphism</E> of an incidence structure &Gamma; is a permutation of the element set of &Gamma;
such that incidence is preserved and types are fixed (i.e. the type of the image of an element
coincides with the type of that element). One way to compute the (full) automorphism group of &Gamma;
is to compute its incidence graph and then use the available <F>nauty</F> machinery to obtain the group.

The group returned is a permutation group acting on the set <F>[1..Sum(TypesOfElementsOfIncidenceStructure(cg), t -> NrElementsOfIncidenceStructure(cg,t))]</F>, which is exactly the vertex set of <F>IncidenceGraph(cg)</F>. At the moment the action of the automorphism group on <F>cg</F> is not provided but it can be recovered from the knowledge that the vertex set of <F>IncidenceGraph(cg)</F> first contains all elements of type 1 in <F>cg</F>, then all elements of type 2, etc. or, better still, with the <Package>GRAPE</Package> command <F>VertexNames</F> (see example below).

<Section>
<Heading>Diagrams</Heading>

The <E>diagram</E> of a flag-transitive incidence geometry is a
schematic description of the structure of the geometry. It is based on
the collection of rank 2 residues of the geometry.<P/>

Technically, the diagram is added to a <F>CosetGeometry</F> object as a mutable attribute. Also the list of rank 2 residues 
of the geometry is added as an attribute once these have been computed. This is done with the operations <F>Rank2Residues</F> 
(to add the attribute) and <F>MakeRank2Residue</F> (to actually compute the resiudes). These operations are not for everyday use and hence remain undocumented.<P/> 

Since the geometry is flag-transitive, all chambers are
equivalent. Let's fix a chamber <Alt Not="HTML"><M>C=\{c_{1}, c_{2},\ldots,c_{n}\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>C=\{c_{1}, c_{2},\ldots,c_{n}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">C = &#123; c&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,c&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>,...,c&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>&#125;</Alt>,
with <Alt Not="HTML"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>c_{i}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub></Alt> of type <M>i</M>. For each subset
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\{i,j\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>\{i,j\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">&#123;i,j&#125;</Alt> of
size two in <Alt Not="HTML"><M>I=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>I=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">&#123;1,2,...n&#125;</Alt>
we take the residue of the flag <Alt Not="HTML"><M>C\setminus \{c_{i},c_{j}\}</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML MathJax"><M>C\setminus \{c_{i},c_{j}\}</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML noMathJax">C \ &#123; c&lt;sub>i&lt;/sub>, c&lt;sub>j&lt;/sub>&#125;</Alt>. Flag transitivity ensures
that <E>all</E> residues of type <M>\{i,j\}</M> are
isomorphic to each other. For each such residue, the structure is
described by some parameters: the gonality and the point and line
diameters. For each type <M>i</M>, we also define the <M>i</M>-order
to be one less than the number of elements of type <M>i</M> in the residue of a(ny) flag of 
type <M>I\setminus\{i\}</M>. All this information is depicted in
a <E>diagram</E> which is bascically a labelled graph with vertex set <M>I</M>
and edges whenever the point diamater, the line diameter and the
gonality are all greater than <M>2</M>.

<Description> 
<A>diag</A> must be a diagram. Writes a file <A>filename</A>.ps in the
current directory with a pictorial version of the diagram. This
command uses the <Package>graphviz</Package> package which is
available from http://www.graphviz.org. <P/>

In case <Package>graphviz</Package> is not available on your system,
you will get an friendly error message and a file <A>filename</A>.dot
will be written. You can then compile this file later or ask a friend
to help you.

By default the diagram provides for each type <M>i</M> the <M>i</M>-order and the number of elements of type <M>i</M>. This behaviour can be changed by providing a <A>vertexverbosity</A> level. A value <A>2</A> results in no label under the vertices and a value <A>1</A> gives only the <M>i</M>-order. Any other potitive integer value yields the default behaviour. 

The default labels for the edges of the diagram use the standard convention that a <M>[g,dp,dl]</M>-gon with all three parameters equal is labelled only with the number <M>g</M>. Putting <A>edgeverbosity</A> equal to <M>2</M> puts no labels at all. This yields the so called ``basic diagram'' of the geometry. With <A>edgeverbosity</A> equal to any integer greater than <M>2</M> all labels contain girth and both diameters.

We illustrate the diagram feature with
Neumaier's <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>-geometry.

The affine space of dimension 3 over the field with two elements is
denoted by <M>AG(3,2)</M>. If we fix a plane <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Pi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#928;</Alt> in <M>PG(3,2)</M>, the
structure induced on the 8 points not in <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Pi</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#928;</Alt> by the lines and planes
of <M>PG(3,2)</M> is isomorphic to <M>AG(3,2)</M>. Since every two points of
<M>AG(3,2)</M> define a line, the collinearity graph of <M>AG(3,2)</M> (that is the graph
whose vertices are the points of <M>AG(3,2)</M> and in which two vertices
are adjacent whenever they are collinear) is the complete graph <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>
on 8 vertices. Given two copies of the complete graph on 8 vertices,
one can label the vertices of each of them with the numbers from 1 to
8. These labelings are always equivalent when the two copies are seen as
graphs, but not if they are understood as models of the affine
space. The reason is that an affine space has parallel lines and to be
affinely equivalent, the labelings must be such that edges which were
parallel in the first labeling remain parallel in the second
labeling. In fact there are 15 affinely nonequivalent ways to label the
vertices of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. The affine space has 14 planes of 4 points and
there are 70 subsets of 4 elements in the vertex set of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. Each
time we label <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>, there are 14 of the 70 sets of 4 elements which
become planes of <M>AG(3,2)</M>. The remaining 4-subsets will be called 
<E>nonplanes</E> for that labeling.

A well-known rank 4 geometry discovered by Neumaier
in 1984 can be described using these concepts. This geometry is quite
important since its residue of cotype <M>1</M> is the famous 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_7</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>7&lt;/sub></Alt>-geometry which is known to be the only flag-transitive locally
classical <M>C_3</M>-geometry which is not a polar space (see Aschbacher1984
for details).

The Neumaier geometry can be constructed as follows. The elements of
types 1 and 2 are the vertices and edges of the complete graph <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>,
the elements of type 3 are the 4-subsets of the vertex set 
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt> and the elements of type 4 are the 15 nonequivalent labelings
of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt>. Incidences are mostly the natural ones. A 4-subset
is incident with a labeling of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>K_8</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">K&lt;sub>8&lt;/sub></Alt> if it is the set of points of a
nonplane in the model of <M>AG(3,2)</M> defined by the labeling.

On a UNIX system we can start an external viewer (``gv'' or ghostview in this case) from within GAP with the <F>Exec</F> command.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="DrawDiagramWithNeato" Arg="diag,filename"/>
<Returns>does not return anything but writes a file <A>filename</A>.ps</Returns>
<Description> 
<A>diag</A> must be a diagram. Writes a file <A>filename</A>.ps in the
current directory with a pictorial version of the diagram. <P/>

This command uses a "spring tension" algorithm to draw the diagram <A>diag</A> with straight edges. For some diagrams this looks 
better than the result of <F>DrawDiagram</F>. However this algorithm does not print the vertex labels.<P/>

This
command uses the <Package>graphviz</Package> package which is
available from http://www.graphviz.org. 
In case <Package>graphviz</Package> is not available on your system,
you will get an friendly error message and a file <A>filename</A>.dot
will be written. You can then compile this file later or ask a friend
to help you.
An <M>E_6</M> geometry for comparison: on the left hand side we have the
output of DrawDiagram and on the right hand side we see the result of
