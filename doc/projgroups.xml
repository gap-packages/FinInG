<Chapter Label="projgroup">
<Heading>Projective Groups</Heading>

A <E>collineation</E> of a projective space is a type preserving bijection of the
elements of the projective space, that preserves incidence. The Fundamental Theorem
of Projective Geometry states that every collineation of a Desarguesian projective
space of dimension at least two is induced by a semilinear map of the underlying vector space.
The group of all linear maps of a given <M>n+1</M>-dimensional
vector space over a given field <M>GF(q)</M> is denoted by <M>GL(n+1,q)</M>. This is a matrix group consisting of all non-singular square <M>n+1</M>-dimensional matrices
over <M>GF(q)</M>. The group of all semilinear maps 
of the vector space <M>V(n,q)</M> is obtained as the semidirect product of
<M>GL(n,q)</M> and <M>Aut(GF(q))</M>, and is denoted by <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt>.
Each semilinear map induces a collineation of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. The
Fundamental theorem of Projective Geometry also guarantees that the converse holds. Note also
that <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> does not act faithfully on the projective points,
and the kernel of its action is the group of scalar matrices, <M>Sc(n+1,q)</M>.
So the group <Alt Not="HTML"><M>P\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> is defined as the group <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\Gamma 
L(n+1,q) / Sc(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#915;L(n+1,q)/Sc(n+1,q)</Alt>, and
<M>PGL(n+1,q) = GL(n+1,q) / Sc(n+1,q)</M>. An element of the group <M>PGL(n+1,q)</M> is also 
called a <E>projectivity</E> or <E>homography</E> of
<M>PG(n,q)</M>, and the group <M>PGL(n+1,q)</M> is called the <E>projectivity
group</E> or <E>homography group</E> of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. An element of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>P\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> is called a <E>collineation</E> of <M>PG(n,q)</M>
and the group <Alt Not="HTML"><M>P\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> is the <E>collineation group</E> of
<M>PG(n,q)</M>.<P/>

As usual, we also consider the special linear group <M>SL(n+1,q)</M>, which is the subgroup of <M>GL(n+1,q)</M>
of all matrices having determinant one. Its projective variant, i.e. <M>PSL(n+1,q) = SL(n+1,q) / Sc(n+1,q)</M>
is called the <E>special homography group</E> or <E>special projectivity group</E> of <M>PG(n,q)</M>.
<P/>

Consider the projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M>. As described in Chapter <Ref
Chap="projective_spaces"/>, a point of <M>PG(n,q)</M> is represented by a row
vector. A <M>k</M>-dimensional subspace of <M>PG(n,q)</M> is represented by a
generating set of <M>k+1</M> points, and as such, by a 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>(k+1) \times (n+1)</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">(k+1) x (n+1)</Alt>
matrix. The convention in <Package>FinInG</Package> is that a collineation  
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt> with underlying matrix <M>A</M> and field automorphism
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#952;</Alt> maps that projective 
point represented by row vector <Alt Not="HTML"><M>(x_0, x_1, \ldots,
x_n)</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">(x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)</Alt>
to the projective point represented by row vector <Alt Not="HTML"><M>(y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_n)
= ((x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) A)^{\theta}</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">(y&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,y&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,y&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>) =
((x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)A)&lt;sup>&#952;&lt;/sup>
</Alt>. This convention determines completely the action of collineations on all elements 
of a projective space, and it follows that the product of two collineations 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi_1,\phi_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#966;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,&#966;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt> with respective
underlying matrices <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_1,A_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,A&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt> and respective underlying
field automorphisms <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta_1,\theta_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,&#952;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt> is the collineation with
underlying matrix <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_1 \cdot A_2^{\theta_1^{-1}}</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>A&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>-1&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup></Alt> 
and underlying field automorphism <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta_1 \theta_2</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&#952;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt>.<P/>

A <E>correlation</E> of the projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M> is a collineation from
<M>PG(n,q)</M> to its dual. A projectivity from <M>PG(n,q)</M> to its dual is
sometimes called a <E>reciprocity</E>. 
The <E>standard duality</E> of the
projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M> maps any point <M>v</M> with coordinates <Alt
Not="HTML"><M>(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">(x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)</Alt> on the hyperplane
with equation <Alt Not="HTML"><M>x_0X_0 + x_1X_1 + \cdots + x_nX_n</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>X&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub> + x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>X&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub> + ...
x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>X&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub> = 0</Alt>. The
standard duality acts as an automorphism on <Alt Not="HTML"><M>P\Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> by mapping the underlying matrix of a collineation
to its inverse transpose matrix. (Recall that the frobenius automorphism and the standard duality commute.) 
The convention in <Package>FinInG</Package> is that a correlation  
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#966;</Alt> with underlying matrix <M>A</M> and field automorphism
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">&#952;</Alt> maps that projective 
point represented by row vector <Alt Not="HTML"><M>(x_0, x_1, \ldots,
x_n)</M></Alt><Alt Only="HTML">(x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)</Alt>
to the projective hyperplane represented by row vector <Alt Not="HTML"><M>(y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_n)
= ((x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) A)^{\theta.}</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">(y&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,y&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,y&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>) =
((x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)A)&lt;sup>&#952;&lt;/sup>.
</Alt>, i.e. <Alt Not="HTML"><M>(y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_n)
= ((x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) A)^{\theta.}</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">(y&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,y&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,y&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>) =
((x&lt;sub>0&lt;/sub>,x&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,...,x&lt;sub>n&lt;/sub>)A)&lt;sup>&#952;&lt;/sup>
</Alt> are the dual coordinates of the hyperplane.<P/>

The product of two correlations of <M>PG(n,q)</M> is a collineation, and the
product of a collineation and a correlaton is a correlation. So the set of all
collineations and correlations of <M>PG(n,q)</M> forms a group, called the
<E>correlation-collineation group</E> of <M>PG(n,q)</M>. 
The correlation-collineation group
of <M>PG(n,q)</M> is isomorphic to the semidirect product of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>P \Gamma L(n+1,q)</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt> with the cyclic group of order 2 generated by the
<E>standard duality</E> of the projective space <M>PG(n,q)</M>. 
The convention determines completely 
the action of correlations and collineations on all elements 
of a projective space, and it follows that the product of two elements of the correlation-collineation group 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\phi_1,\phi_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#966;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,&#966;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt> with respective
underlying matrices <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_1,A_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,A&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt>, respective underlying
field automorphisms <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta_1,\theta_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,&#952;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt>, and respective underlying 
projective space isomorphisms (standard duality or identity map) <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\delta_1,\delta_2</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">&#948;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>,&#948;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt>, is the element of 
the correlation-collineation group with underlying matrix <Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_1 (A_2^{\theta_1^{-1}})^{\delta_1}</M></Alt><Alt
Only="HTML">A&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>(A&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&lt;sup>-1&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup>)
&lt;sup>&#948;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&lt;/sup>
</Alt>,
underlying field automorphism <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\theta_1 \theta_2</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">&#952;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&#952;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub></Alt>, and underlying projective space automorphism 
<Alt Not="HTML"><M>\delta_1 \delta_2.</M></Alt>
<Alt Only="HTML">&#948;&lt;sub>1&lt;/sub>&#948;&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>
</Alt>, where the action of <Alt Not="HTML"><M>\delta_1</M></Alt><Alt

<Alt Not="HTML"><M>A_2</M></Alt><Alt

<P/>
Action functions for collineations and correlations on the subspaces of
a projective space are described in detail in Section <Ref Sect="projgroup_actions"/>
<P/>
We mention that the commands <F>PGL</F> (and <F>ProjectiveGeneralLinearGroup</F>) 
and <F>PSL</F> (and <F>ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup</F>) are available in GAP 
and return a (permutation) group isomorphic to the required group. Therefore we do
not provide new methods for these commands, but assume that the user will obtain these
groups as homography or special homography group of the appropriate projective space.
We will follow this philosophy for the other classical groups. The terminology <E>projective semilinear group</E>
will be used for a group generated by collineations of a projective space.


<Section>
<Heading> Projectivities, collineations and correlations of projective spaces.</Heading>
<!--As explained in the introduction, mathematically, the underlying object of a projectivity of a projective space is a nonsingular matrix. The underlying objects of a collineation of a projective space is a nonsingular matrix and a field automorphism (which might be the identity), and the underlying objects of a correlation of a projective space is a nonsingular matrix, a field automorphism, and an isomorphism between the projective space and its dual space.

These are the different type of actions on projective spaces in <Package>FinInG</Package>, and they naturally give rise to the following
representations.

This means that an object in the category <C>IsProjGrpEl</C> has as underlying object a matrix; an object in the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrob</C> has as underlying object a pair consisting of a matrix and a field automorphism; and <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C> has as underlying object a triple consisting of a matrix, a field automorphism and an isomorphism from the projective space to its dual space.

These are the different type of actions on projective spaces in <Package>FinInG</Package>, and they naturally 
give rise to the following distinct categories and representations. Note that these categories and representations 
are to be considered on a non-user level. Below we describe all user constuction methods that hide nicely these
technical details.

<C>IsProjGrpEl</C>, <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrob</C>, and <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C> are the categories

<Filt Name="IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsomRep" Type="Representation"/>
<Description>
<C>IsProjGrpElRep</C> is the representation naturally induced by a projectivity; <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobRep</C> is the 
representation naturally induced by the notion of a collineation of projective space; and <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsomRep</C> 
is the representation naturally induced by a correlation of a projective space. 
This means that an object in the representation <C>IsProjGrpElRep</C> has as underlying object a matrix; an object in the category 
<C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobRep</C> has as underlying object a pair consisting of a matrix and a field automorphism; and 
<C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsomRep</C> has as underlying object a triple consisting of a matrix, a field automorphism 
and an isomorphism from the projective space to its dual space. Also the basefield is stored as a
component in the representation. 
</Description>
</ManSection>

The above mentioned categories allow us to make a distinction between projectivities, collineations and correlations apart
from their representation. However, in <Package>FinInG</Package>, a group element constructed in the categories <C>IsProjGrpElMore</C>
is always constructed in the representation <C>IsProjGrpElMoreRep</C>. Furthermore, projectivities of projective spaces (and 
also collineations of projective spaces) will by default be constructed in the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobRep</C>. 
This technical choice was made by the developpers to have the projectivity groups naturally embedded in the collineation groups.
Correlations of projective spaces will be constructed in the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C>. 

<!--This means that an object in the category <C>IsProjGrpEl</C> has as

<Heading>Projectivities</Heading>
<Filt Name="IsProjectivity" Type="Property"/>
<Description>
<C>IsProjectivity</C> is a property.
Projectivities are the elements of <M>PGL(n+1,q)</M>. Every element belonging to <C>IsProjGrpEl</C> is by construction a projectivity. If <C>IsProjectivity</C> is applied to a an element
belonging to <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrob</C>, then it verifies whether the
underlying field automorphism is the identity.
If <C>IsProjectivity</C> is applied to a an element
belonging to <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C>, 
then it verifies whether the
underlying field automorphism is the identity, and whether the projective
space isomorphism is the identity.
This operation provides a user-friendly method to distinguish the projectivities from the projective strictly
semilinear maps, and the correlations of a projective space.

elements belonging to <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrob</C> are collineations.

<C>IsStrictlySemilinear</C> is a property that checks whether a given collineation has a nontrivial underlying field automorphisms,

Only="HTML">P&#915;L(n+1,q)</Alt>, but not to <M>PGL(n+1,q)</M>. 

If <C>IsStrictlySemilinear</C> is applied to a an element

This is a global function that returns the action of an element <A>el</A> of the collineation group on a subspace <A>subspace</A> of a projective space.
<Par/><B>IMPORTANT:</B> This function should only be used for objects <A>el</A> in the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrob</C>!
This is because this function does not check whether <A>el</A> is a correlation or a collineation. So when <A>el</A> is a object in the category <C>IsProjGrpElWithFrobWithPSIsom</C>, and <A>el</A> is a correlation (i.e. the associated PSIsom is NOT the identity) then this action will not give the image of the <A>subspace</A> under the correlation <A>el</A>.

group of <M>S</M>, a nice monomorphism for <M>G</M> is a homomorphism from <M>G</M> to the permutation action
of <M>S</M> on a collection of elements of <M>S</M>. Thus, to obtain such a homomorphism, one has to enumerate 
the collection of elements. As nice monomorphisms for projective semilinear groups are often computed as a
byproduct of some operations, suddenly, these operations get time consuming (when executed for the first time).
In general, it is decided automatically whether a nice monomorphism is computed or not. A typical example is the following.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NiceMonomorphism" Arg="g"/>
<Returns>an action, i.e. a group homomorphism</Returns>
<Description>
<A>g</A> is a projective semilinear group. If <A>g</A> was constructed as a group stabilizing a geometry, 
the action of <A>g</A> on the points of the geometry is returned.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="NiceObject" Arg="g"/>
<Returns>a permutation group</Returns>
<Description>
<A>g</A> is a projective semilinear group. If <A>g</A> was constructed as a group stabilizing a geometry, 
the permutation representation of <A>g</A> acting on the points of the geometry is returned. This is actually
equivalent with <F>Image(NiceMonomorphism(g))</F>.

<ManSection>
<Var Name="FINING"/>
<Description>
The global variable <C>FINING</C> stores a record with two components, <C>FINING.Fast</C> and <C>FINING.LimitForCanComputeActionOnPoints</C>
By default, <C>FINING.Fast</C> is set to <K>true</K>. Setting <C>FINING.Fast</C> to <K>false</K> causes the use of the generic
<Package>GAP</Package> function <F>ActionHomomorphism</F> instead of the functions <F>NiceMonomorphismByDomain</F> and <F>NiceMonomorphismByOrbit</F>, which
both rely on the packages <Package>GenSS</Package> and <Package>Orb</Package>.

</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="CanComputeActionOnPoints" Arg="g"/>
<Returns>true or false</Returns>
<Description><A>g</A> must be a projective group. This function returns
true if GAP can feasibly compute the action of <A>g</A> on the
points of the projective space on which it acts. This function can be used
(and is, by other parts of FinInG) to determine whether it is worth
trying to compute the action.

This function actually checks if the number of points of the corresponding
projective space is less than the constant
<C>FINING.LimitForCanComputeActionOnPoints</C>, which is by default set to <M>1000000</M>.
The next example requires about 500M of memory.
