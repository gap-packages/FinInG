<!-- In the next line, in the DOCTYPE specification, we are going to include a file containing definitions of entities that are shortcuts to long xml code that is (unfortunately) necessary to produce e.g. a nicely readable PG(n,q) under three circumstances: (1) in HTML using MathJax, in HTML no using MathJax, and in all the rest. Note that the code for HTML with MathJax and LaTeX is obviously the same, but it is not possible to specify alternatives like "only in HTML with MathJax", and "all the rest". Therefore, the HTML part requires the use of two ALTs. Also note that "entity" is available then as &entity;. So use e.g. &pgnq; to get PG(n,q). -->

<Acknowledgements>
The development phase of <Package>FinInG</Package> started roughly in 2005. The idea to write a package for 
projective geometry in GAP had emerged before, and resulted in <Package>pg</Package>, a relic that still
can be found in the undeposited packages section of the GAP website. 
One of the main objectives was to develop the new package was to 
create a tighter connection between finite geometry and the group theoretical functions present in GAP.
<P/>
The authors thank Michael Pauley, Maska Law and Sven Reichard, for their contributions during the early days of the project.
<P/>
Jan De Beule and Michel Lavrauw have been supported by the Research Foundation Flanders -- Belgium (FWO), and
John Bamberg has been supported by a Marie Curie grant and an ARC grant during almost the whole development
phase of <Package>FinInG</Package>. The authors are grateful for this support.


<P/>
John Bamberg, Philippe Cara and Jan De Beule have spent several weeks in Vicenza while developing <Package>FinInG</Package>.
We acknowledge the hospitality of Michel Lavrauw and Corrado Zanella. Our stays in Vicenza were always fruitful and very
enjoyable. During or daily morning and afternoon coffee breaks, we discussed several topics, while enjoying coffee in <E>Caffe Pigaffeta</E>.
<!--<Homepage>http://www.caffepigafetta.com</Homepage> Their real website seems offline, and I refuse to link to facebook-->
Although one cannot acknowledge everybody, such as the bakery who provided us with the sandwiches,
we acknowledge very much the hospitality of Carla and Luigi, who introduced us to many different kinds of coffees from all over the world.
